- Create small Rails Blog (on Heroku)
-- "Adventures in Hobo world..."

- do logging test in my-rails/logging/test
-- It works! Why not in Rails!?
- Try rails debug!

- Insert 'debugger' statements
- ss --debugger
- Ensure script "create hobo app edge, has config.gem 'hobo' commented out or removed!"

http://guides.rubyonrails.org/debugging_rails_applications.html

- Add Tracing (tracer.rb?)
- Add logging
- Find root of templating and start investigating from here to get a sense of the main flow...
- Tweak it one small step at a time...
- Use Needle for logging/tracing (see email)
- Let DrymlExt be called with either a has of configurations or an instance of class DrymlExtConfig, containing same parameters

class DrymlExtConfig
  def sub_result_handler
  end

  def all_result_handler
  end

  def init_result
  end
end
