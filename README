Uncovering the secrets of Hobo DRYML...
---

This Hobo application is based on a Hobo edge application which has since been modified to include lot of logging functionality and logging statements. 
This has been done to uncover some of the "magic secrets" of DRYML, so that Hobo extension providers (such as myself!) can get a better understanding of the DRYML templating process, and hence be better able to tweak it and add more advanced functionality and customizations.

Logging is currently provided by libs/logging.rb which contains a few modules that are included in select DRYML classes. 
One such module is: Logging, which contains some logging helper methods. 

The following Hobo::Dryml classes includes the Logging module:

- DRYMLBuilder
- Template
- TemplateEnvironment
- Taglib

The result of each DRYML erb generation is output to a .dryml.erb file in the same folder as the original .dryml file (for easy comparison). 

Example:
When DRYML compiles front/index.dryml, the final .erb output is stored as front/index.dryml.erb (thanks to Brett Nelson for this patch!)

The rapid library is compiled (and cached!) when the first page of an application is compiled and displayed. This process has also been uncovered here.
The resulting .erb files from this proces are saved in the folder /app/views/taglibs/rapid/ where core.dryml becomes core.dryml.erb
Currently this .erb file is only created if it doesn't exists already in. If you change the .dryml file you should delete the corresponding .erb file manually to
effectively delte the "cache", or change the login in logging.rb to not test for the existence of the .erb file : unless File.exist?(file).
